# Panel overview

The *panel* is the basic visualization building block in Grafana. Each panel has a query editor specific to the data source selected in the panel. The query editor allows you to extract the perfect visualization to display on the panel.

There are a wide variety of styling and formatting options for each panel. Panels can be dragged and dropped and rearranged on the dashboard. They can also be resized.

## Move panels

You can drag and drop panels by clicking and holding the panel title, then dragging it to its new location. You can also easily resize panels by clicking the (-) and (+) icons.
